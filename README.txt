The project produced a program named AAST for inferring tree-child networks with the smallest hybridization number (HN) 
that display all the input trees given in Newick format.

Arb_Ntk_Approx_NW.c    the version 1 of the C-code of ALTS
ALTS_v2.c              the current version of the c-code of ALTS
ALTS_v3.c              the version for input trees with different taxa. It outputs a network on the whole set of taxa.

20lfs_10trs_50sets.zip   a collection of 50 datasets which each contains 10 tree with 20 taxa.  
40lfs_10trs_50sets.zip   a collection of 50 datasets which each contains 10 tree with 40 taxa.
